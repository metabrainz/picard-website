          file you add and look for an <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/AcoustID" title="AcoustID">AcoustID</a>
          fingerprint. This takes time, but may be helpful for you and MusicBrainz. Leave it unchecked if you don't
          want Picard to do this scan automatically. In any case, you can direct Picard to scan a particular

        <li>
          <b>Use standardized instrument and vocal credits:</b> Check to only use standard names for
          instruments and vocals in performer relationships. Uncheck to use the instruments / vocals as
          credited in the relationship.

        <li>
          <b>Convert Unicode punctuation characters to ASCII:</b> Converts Unicode punctuation characters
          in MusicBrainz data to ASCII for consistent use of punctuation in tags. For example, right
          single quotation marks (’) are converted to ASCII apostrophes ('), and horizontal ellipses
          (…) are converted to three full stops (.).

          <b>ID3v2 version:</b> Although id3v2.4 is the latest version, its support in music players

          <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.mediamonkey.com">MediaMonkey</a>have
          no problem using version 2.4 tags, you will not be able to read the tags in Windows Explorer
          or Windows Media Player (in any Windows or WMP version, including those in Windows 8.1).
          Apple iTunes is also still based in id3v23, and support for id3v24 in other media players
          (such as smartphones) is variable. Other than native support for multi-valued tags in v2.4, the
          <a href="/docs/mappings" title="Picard Tag Mapping">Picard Tag Mapping</a>
          will show you what you lose when choosing v2.3 instead of v2.4.

        <li>
          <b>ID3v2 text encoding:</b> The default for version 2.4 is UTF-8, the default for version 2.3
          is UTF-16. Use ISO-8859-1 <b>only</b> if you face compatibility issues with your player.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Join id3v23 tags with:</b> As mentioned above, id3v23 does not support multi-value tags, and
          so Picard flattens these to strings before saving them to id3v23 tags. This setting defines
          the string used to separate the values when flattened. Use '; ' for the greatest compatibility
          (rather than '/' since tags more often contain a / than a&#160;;) and for the best visual compatibility
          in Picard between id3v23 and other tagging formats.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Save iTunes compatible grouping and work:</b> Save the tags <code>grouping</code> and
          <code>work</code> so that they are compatible with current iTunes versions. Without this option
          <code>grouping</code> will be displayed in iTunes as "work name" and <code>work</code> will not be
          available. See the <a href="/docs/mappings" title="Picard Tag Mapping">Picard Tag Mapping</a> for
          details.<br>
          <em>Note: For other players supporting grouping and work you might need to disable this option. MusicBee is one example for this.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Also include ID3v1 tags in the files:</b> Not recommended at all. ID3v1.1 tags are obsolete

          <b>Embed cover images into tags:</b> Enables images to be embedded directly into your music files.
          Whilst this will use more storage space than storing it as a separate image file in the same
          folder, some music players will only display embedded images and don't find the separate files.

        <li>
          <b>Only embed a front image:</b> Embeds only a front image into your music files. Many music players

        <li>
          <b>Cover Art Archive:</b> The Cover Art Archive (CAA) is MusicBrainz own archive of cover art
          in cooperation with the Internet Archive (archive.org). If art is available there, the Cover
          Art Archive is the most comprehensive database of cover art (front covers, back covers, booklets,
          CDs etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CAA Release Group:</b> This provider uses the Cover Art Archive cover image assigned to the
          release group. This is usually the image that best describes the release group as a whole or
          the image with the best visual quality, but is not necessarily the exact cover of the release
          your are tagging. This provider is a good choice if you care more about visual quality then having
          an exact representation of your release. It is also a good fallback for the Cover Art Archive provider.

        <li>
          <b>Amazon:</b> Amazon often has cover art when other sites don't, however whilst this art is almost
          always for the correct Artist/Album, it may not be the absolute correct cover art for the specific
          Release that you have tagged your music with.
        </li>

      <h2 id="cover_art_archive">Cover Art Archive</h2>

      <p>In this section you can decide which types of cover art you would like to download from the Cover
        Art Archive, and what quality (size) you want to download. Obviously, the better the quality,
        the larger the size of the files.
      </p>
      <p>Most music players will display only one piece of cover art for the album, and most people select
        Front (cover) for that.
      </p>
      <p>When selecting the cover art image types, you can select both the types to include and exclude from
        the download list.  CAA images with an image type found in the '<i>Include</i>' list will be downloaded
        and used unless they also have an image type found in the '<i>Exclude</i>' list. Images with types found
        in the '<i>Exclude</i>' list will <b>never</b> be used. Image types not appearing in the '<i>Include</i>'
        or '<i>Exclude</i>' lists will not be considered when determining whether or not to download and use a
        CAA image.
      </p>
      <p>Since Picard 1.3, you can also decide to use the image from the release group (if any) if no front
        image is found for the release. In this case, the cover may not match the exact release you are
        tagging (eg. a 1979 vinyl front cover may be used in place of the Deluxe 2010 CD reissue).
      </p>

      <h2 id="local_files">Local Files</h2>

      <p>
        In this section you can configure the file names to be used by the Local Files cover art provider. The
        file names are defined using a regular expression. The default is to load files with the name
        <code>cover</code>, <code>folder</code> or <code>albumart</code> and the file extension <code>jpg</code>,
        <code>png</code>, <code>gif</code> or <code>tiff</code> (e.g. <code>folder.jpg</code> or <code>cover.png</code>).

      <h1 id="filerenaming">File Naming</h1>

      <p>This page tells Picard whether it should move your audio files to a new directory when it saves
        metadata in them. One use for this is to keep your work organised: all untagged files are under
        directory A, and when Picard tags them it moves them to directory B. When directory A is empty,
        your tagging work is done. Check this box, and select a destination directory, if you want Picard
        to move files this way. Uncheck the box if you want Picard to leave the files under the same
        directory.
      </p>
      <p>The <i>Rename Files</i> and <i>Move Files</i> options are independent. Rename Files refers to Picard
        changing file names typically based on artist and track names. Move Files refers to Picard moving
        files to new directories, based on a stated parent directory and sub-directories typically based
        on album artist name and release title. However, they both use the same "file naming string".
        Move files uses the portion up until the last '/'; rename files the part after that.
      </p>

      <ul class="options">
        <li> <b>Rename files when saving:</b> Check to let Picard change file and directory names of your files
          when it saves metadata in them, in order to make the file and directory names consistent with
          the new metadata.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Replace non-ASCII characters:</b> Check to replace non-ASCII characters with their ASCII equivalent,
          e.g. á,ä,ǎ, with a; é,ě,ë, with e; æ with ae, etc. For more information on ASCII characters
          read the Wikipedia page on
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ASCII">ASCII</a>.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Replace Windows-incompatible characters:</b> Check to replace Windows-incompatible characters
          with an underscore. Enabled by default on Windows with no option to disable.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Move files to this directory when saving:</b> Choose a destination parent directory to move
          saved files to.
          <ul class="options">
            <li>If you use the directory "," they will be removed relative to their current location. If
              they are already in some sort of folder structure, this will probably <i>not</i> do what
              you want!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <b>Delete empty directories:</b> Check to have Picard remove directories that have become empty
          once a move is completed. Leave unchecked if you want Picard to leave the source directory
          structure unchanged. Checking this box may be convenient if you are using the move files option
          to organise your work. An empty directory has no more work for you to do, and deleting the
          directory makes that clear.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Move additional files:</b> Enter wildcard patterns that match any other files you want Picard
          to move when saving files, e.g.
          <code>Folder.jpg</code>,
          <code>*.png</code>,
          <code>*.cue</code>,
          <code>*.log</code>. Using default settings, when these additional files are moved they will end up
          in the release directory with your files. In a wildcard,
          <code>*</code>matches zero or more characters. Other text, like
          <code>.jpg</code>, matches those exact characters. Thus
          <code>*.jpg</code>matches "cover.jpg", "liner.jpg", "a.jpg", and ".jpg", but not "nomatch.jpg2".
          Put spaces between wildcard patterns.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul class="options">
        <li>
          <b>Name files like this:</b> An edit box that contains a formatting string that tells Picard what
          the new name of the file and its containing directories should be, in terms of various metadata
          values. The formatting string is in Picard's
          <a href="/docs/mappings/" title="Picard Scripting">scripting language</a>
          where dark blue text starting with a "$" is a function name and names in light blue within "%" signs
          are Picard's <a href="/docs/tags/" title="Picard Tags">tag names</a>.
          Note that the use of a "/" in the formatting  string means that everything before the string is a
          directory name, and everything after the last "/" becomes the file's name.
          The formatting string is allowed to have zero, one, or multiple, "/".
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1 id="fingerprinting">Fingerprinting</h1>

      <p>
        If you select a file or cluster in the Left side of the Picard screen and click Scan, Picard will
        invoke a program to scan the file and produce a fingerprint that can then be used to look up
        the file on MusicBrainz.
      </p>
      <p>
        MusicBrainz currently supports only <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/AcoustID" title="AcoustID">AcoustID</a>
        (an Open Source <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Fingerprinting" title="Fingerprinting">acoustic fingerprinting</a>
        system created by <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/User:LukasLalinsky" title="User:LukasLalinsky">Lukáš Lalinský</a>)
        but has previously supported TRM and MusicID PUID.
      </p>

      <h1 id="cdlookup">CD lookup</h1>

      <p>
        This is where you tell Picard which CD drive it should use for looking up CDs.
      </p>

      <h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>

      <p>
        On Windows, Picard has a pulldown menu listing the various CD drives it has found. Pull down the
        menu and select the drive you want.
      </p>

      <h2 id="os_x">OS X</h2>

      <p>
        In OS X, this option is currently a text field. The device is usually /dev/rdisk1.
      </p>
      <p>
        If that doesn't work, one way is to simply keep increasing the number (e.g. /dev/rdisk2) until
        it does work. A less trial and error method is to open Terminal and type
        <code>mount</code>. The output should include a line such as
        <code>/dev/disk2 on /Volumes/Audio CD (local, nodev, nosuid, read-only)</code>. You need to replace
        /dev/disk with /dev/rdisk, so if, for example, it says /dev/disk2, you should enter /dev/<b>r</b>disk2
        in Picard's preferences.
      </p>

      <h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>

      <p>In Linux, Picard has a pulldown menu like in Windows. If you're using an older version with a text
        field, you should enter the device name (typically /dev/cdrom) here.
      </p>

      <h2 id="other_platforms">Other platforms</h2>

      <p>
        On other platforms, the CD Lookup option is a text field and you should enter the path to the CD
        drive here.
      </p>

      <h1 id="plugins">Plugins</h1>

      <p>
        Here you may enable/disable any of the plugins you have installed in Picard. Note that some plugins
        have their own option page which will appear under here.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a list of plugins see <a href="/plugins/" title="Picard Plugins">Picard Plugins</a>.
      </p>

      <h1 id="interface">User interface</h1>

      <ul class="options">
        <li>
          <b>Show text labels under icon:</b> Uncheck to make the toolbar a little smaller.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Allow selection of multiple directories:</b> Check to bypass the native directory selector
          and use QT's file dialog since the native directory selector usually doesn't allow you to select
          more than one directory. This applies for the 'Add folder' dialog, the file browser always
          allows multiple directory selection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Use advanced query syntax:</b> Check to enable
          <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Text_Search_Syntax" title="Text Search Syntax">advanced query syntax</a>
          parsing on your searches.
          This only applies for the search box at the top right of Picard, not the lookup buttons.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Show a quit confirmation dialog for unsaved changes:</b> Check to show a dialog when you try
          to quit Picard with unsaved files loaded. This may help prevent accidentally losing tag changes
          you've made, but not yet saved.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Begin browsing in the following directory:</b> By default, Picard remembers the last directory
          you loaded files from. If you check this box and provide a directory, Picard will start in
          the directory provided instead.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>User interface language:</b> By default, Picard will display in the language displayed by your
          operating system, however you can override this here if needed.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="network">Networking</h2>

      <h3>Web Proxy</h3>

      <p>
        If you need a proxy to make an outside connection you may specify one here.
      </p>

      <h3>Browser Integration</h3>

      <p>
        The browser integration allows you to load releases and recordings into
        Picard directly from the MusicBrainz website. Once you have opened musicbrainz.org
        in your browser from Picard the website will show the green tagger button
        <img alt="Tagger" src="https://staticbrainz.org/MB/mblookup-tagger-b8fe559.png">
        next to releases and recordings, clicking on this button will load the corresponding
        release or recording into Picard.
      </p>

      <ul class="options">
        <li> <b>Default listening port:</b> The default port Picard will listen on
          for the browser integration. If the port is not available Picard will try
          to increase the port number by one until it finds a free port.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Listen only on localhost:</b> By default Picard will limit access to
          the browser integration port to your local machine. Deactivating this option
          will expose the port on your network, allowing you to request Picard to
          load a specific release or recording via the network. This is used for
          example by the <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.musicbrainz.picard.barcodescanner">Picard Barcode Scanner</a>
          Android app.<br>
          <br>
          <em>Warning: Only enable this option when you actually need it and only on
          networks you trust. Exposing application ports via the network can open
          potential security holes on your system.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="matching">Matching</h2>

      <p>
        It is recommended for most users to not change these settings. However for advanced users, it allows
        you to tune the way Picard matches your files and clusters to to MusicBrainz releases and tracks.
      </p>

      <ul class="options">
        <li> <b>Minimal similarity for file lookups:</b> The higher then&#160;%, the more similar an individual
          file's metadata must be to MusicBrainz's metadata for it to be moved/matched to a release on
          the right-hand side.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Minimal similarity for cluster lookups:</b> The higher then&#160;%, the more similar a cluster
          of files from the left-hand pane must be to a MusicBrainz release for the entire cluster to
          be moved/matched to a release on the right-hand side.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Minimal similarity for matching files to tracks:</b> The higher then&#160;%, the more similar
          an individual file's metadata must be to MusicBrainz's metadata for it to be moved/matched
          to a release on the right-hand side.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have absolutely no metadata in your current files, and you are using <b>Scan</b> to match
        tracks, you may find you need to lower <i>Minimal similarity for matching files to tracks</i> in
        order to get Picard to match the files within a release. Otherwise you may find that Picard matches
        the track to a release but then is not sure which track is correct; and leaves it in an "unmatched
        files" group within that release.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a general rule, lowering the percentages may increase the chance of finding a match at the risk
        of false positives and incorrect matches.
