      <ul class="options">
        <li>
          <b>ID3v2 version:</b> Although id3v2.4 is the latest version, its support in music players
          is <b>still</b> lacking. Whilst software such as
          <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.foobar2000.org">foobar2000</a> and
          <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mediamonkey.com">MediaMonkey</a>have
          no problem using version 2.4 tags, you will not be able to read the tags in Windows Explorer
          or Windows Media Player (in any Windows or WMP version, including those in Windows 8.1).
          Apple iTunes is also still based in id3v23, and support for id3v24 in other media players
          (such as smartphones) is variable. Other than native support for multi-valued tags in v2.4, the
          <a href="/docs/mappings" title="Picard Tag Mapping">Picard Tag Mapping</a>
          will show you what you lose when choosing v2.3 instead of v2.4.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ID3v2 text encoding:</b> The default for version 2.4 is UTF-8, the default for version 2.3
          is UTF-16. Use ISO-8859-1 <b>only</b> if you face compatibility issues with your player.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Join id3v23 tags with:</b> As mentioned above, id3v23 does not support multi-value tags, and
          so Picard flattens these to strings before saving them to id3v23 tags. This setting defines
          the string used to separate the values when flattened. Use '; ' for the greatest compatibility
          (rather than '/' since tags more often contain a / than a&#160;;) and for the best visual compatibility
          in Picard between id3v23 and other tagging formats.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Also include ID3v1 tags in the files:</b> Not recommended at all. ID3v1.1 tags are obsolete

        <li>
          <b>Embed cover images into tags:</b> Enables images to be embedded directly into your music files.
          Whilst this will use more storage space than storing it as a separate image file in the same
          folder, some music players will only display embedded images and don't find the separate files.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Only embed a front image:</b> Embeds only a front image into your music files. Many music players
          will only display a single embedded image, so embedding additional images may not add any functionality.
        </li>
        <li>

      <p>
        Picard can download Cover Art from a number of sources, and you can choose which sources you want

      </p>

      <ul class="options">
        <li>
          <b>Cover Art Archive:</b> The Cover Art Archive (CAA) is MusicBrainz own archive of cover art
          in cooperation with the Internet Archive (archive.org). If art is available there, the Cover
          Art Archive is the most comprehensive database of cover art (front covers, back covers, booklets,
          CDs etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Amazon:</b> Amazon often has cover art when other sites don't, however whilst this art is almost
          always for the correct Artist/Album, it may not be the absolute correct cover art for the specific
          Release that you have tagged your music with.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Sites on the whitelist:</b>

      </ul>

      <p>
        <i>Note: CD Baby and other whitelist sites are no longer being used by MusicBrainz for new Cover Art.</i>
      </p>

      <h3 id="cover_art_archive">Cover Art Archive</h3>

      <p>In this section you can decide which types of cover art you would like to download from the Cover
        Art Archive, and what quality (size) you want to download. Obviously, the better the quality,
        the larger the size of the files.
      </p>
      <p>Most music players will display only one piece of cover art for the album, and most people select
        Front (cover) for that.
      </p>
      <p>Since Picard 1.3, you can also decide to use the image from the release group (if any) if no front
        image is found for the release. In this case, the cover may not match the exact release you are
        tagging (eg. a 1979 vinyl front cover may be used in place of the Deluxe 2010 CD reissue).
      </p>

      <h1 id="file_naming">File Naming</h1>

      <p>This page tells Picard whether it should move your audio files to a new directory when it saves
        metadata in them. One use for this is to keep your work organised: all untagged files are under
        directory A, and when Picard tags them it moves them to directory B. When directory A is empty,
        your tagging work is done. Check this box, and select a destination directory, if you want Picard
        to move files this way. Uncheck the box if you want Picard to leave the files under the same
        directory.
      </p>
      <p>The <i>Rename Files</i> and <i>Move Files</i> options are independent. Rename Files refers to Picard
        changing file names typically based on artist and track names. Move Files refers to Picard moving
        files to new directories, based on a stated parent directory and sub-directories typically based
        on album artist name and release title. However, they both use the same "file naming string".
        Move files uses the portion up until the last '/'; rename files the part after that.
      </p>

      <ul class="options">
        <li> <b>Rename files when saving:</b> Check to let Picard change file and directory names of your files
          when it saves metadata in them, in order to make the file and directory names consistent with
          the new metadata.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Replace non-ASCII characters:</b> Check to replace non-ASCII characters with their ASCII equivalent,
          e.g. á,ä,ǎ, with a; é,ě,ë, with e; æ with ae, etc. For more information on ASCII characters
          read the Wikipedia page on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ASCII">ASCII</a>.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Replace Windows-incompatible characters:</b> Check to replace Windows-incompatible characters
          with an underscore. Enabled by default on Windows with no option to disable.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Move files to this directory when saving:</b> Choose a destination parent directory to move
          saved files to.
          <ul class="options">
            <li>If you use the directory "," they will be removed relative to their current location. If
              they are already in some sort of folder structure, this will probably <i>not</i> do what
              you want!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <b>Delete empty directories:</b> Check to have Picard remove directories that have become empty
          once a move is completed. Leave unchecked if you want Picard to leave the source directory
          structure unchanged. Checking this box may be convenient if you are using the move files option
          to organise your work. An empty directory has no more work for you to do, and deleting the
          directory makes that clear.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Move additional files:</b> Enter wildcard patterns that match any other files you want Picard
          to move when saving files, e.g.
          <code>Folder.jpg</code>,
          <code>*.png</code>,
          <code>*.cue</code>,
          <code>*.log</code>. Using default settings, when these additional files are moved they will end up
          in the release directory with your files. In a wildcard,
          <code>*</code>matches zero or more characters. Other text, like
          <code>.jpg</code>, matches those exact characters. Thus
          <code>*.jpg</code>matches "cover.jpg", "liner.jpg", "a.jpg", and ".jpg", but not "nomatch.jpg2".
          Put spaces between wildcard patterns.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul class="options">
        <li>
          <b>Name files like this:</b> An edit box that contains a formatting string that tells Picard what
          the new name of the file and its containing directories should be, in terms of various metadata
          values. The formatting string is in Picard's
          <a href="/docs/mappings/" title="Picard Scripting">scripting language</a>
          where dark blue text starting with a "$" is a function name and names in light blue within "%" signs
          are Picard's <a href="/docs/tags/" title="Picard Tags">tag names</a>.
          Note that the use of a "/" in the formatting  string means that everything before the string is a
          directory name, and everything after the last "/" becomes the file's name.
          The formatting string is allowed to have zero, one, or multiple, "/".
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1 id="fingerprinting">Fingerprinting</h1>

      <p>
        If you select a file or cluster in the Left side of the Picard screen and click Scan, Picard will
        invoke a program to scan the file and produce a fingerprint that can then be used to look up
        the file on MusicBrainz.
      </p>
      <p>
        MusicBrainz currently supports only <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/doc/AcoustID" title="AcoustID">AcoustID</a>
        (an Open Source <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/doc/Fingerprinting" title="Fingerprinting">acoustic fingerprinting</a>
        system created by <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/doc/User:LukasLalinsky" title="User:LukasLalinsky">Lukáš Lalinský</a>)
        but has previously supported TRM and MusicID PUID.
      </p>

      <h1 id="cd_lookup">CD lookup</h1>

      <p>
        This is where you tell Picard which CD drive it should use for looking up CDs.
      </p>

      <h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>

      <p>
        On Windows, Picard has a pulldown menu listing the various CD drives it has found. Pull down the
        menu and select the drive you want.
      </p>

      <h3 id="os_x">OS X</h3>

      <p>
        In OS X, this option is currently a text field. The device is usually /dev/rdisk1.
      </p>
      <p>
        If that doesn't work, one way is to simply keep increasing the number (e.g. /dev/rdisk2) until
        it does work. A less trial and error method is to open Terminal and type
        <code>mount</code>. The output should include a line such as
        <code>/dev/disk2 on /Volumes/Audio CD (local, nodev, nosuid, read-only)</code>. You need to replace
        /dev/disk with /dev/rdisk, so if, for example, it says /dev/disk2, you should enter /dev/<b>r</b>disk2
        in Picard's preferences.
      </p>

      <h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>

      <p>In Linux, Picard has a pulldown menu like in Windows. If you're using an older version with a text
        field, you should enter the device name (typically /dev/cdrom) here.
      </p>

      <h3 id="other_platforms">Other platforms</h3>

      <p>
        On other platforms, the CD Lookup option is a text field and you should enter the path to the CD
        drive here.
      </p>

      <h1 id="plugins">Plugins</h1>

      <p>
        Here you may enable/disable any of the plugins you have installed in Picard. Note that some plugins

        It is recommended for most users to not change these settings. However for advanced users, it allows
        you to tune the way Picard matches your files and clusters to to MusicBrainz releases and tracks.
      </p>

      <ul class="options">
        <li> <b>Minimal similarity for file lookups:</b> The higher then&#160;%, the more similar an individual
          file's metadata must be to MusicBrainz's metadata for it to be moved/matched to a release on
          the right-hand side.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Minimal similarity for cluster lookups:</b> The higher then&#160;%, the more similar a cluster
          of files from the left-hand pane must be to a MusicBrainz release for the entire cluster to
          be moved/matched to a release on the right-hand side.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Minimal similarity for matching files to tracks:</b> The higher then&#160;%, the more similar
          an individual file's metadata must be to MusicBrainz's metadata for it to be moved/matched
          to a release on the right-hand side.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have absolutely no metadata in your current files, and you are using <b>Scan</b> to match
        tracks, you may find you need to lower <i>Minimal similarity for matching files to tracks</i> in
        order to get Picard to match the files within a release. Otherwise you may find that Picard matches
        the track to a release but then is not sure which track is correct; and leaves it in an "unmatched
        files" group within that release.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a general rule, lowering the percentages may increase the chance of finding a match at the risk
        of false positives and incorrect matches.

      <h3 id="user_interface">User interface</h3>

      <ul class="options">
        <li>
          <b>Show text labels under icon:</b> Uncheck to make the toolbar a little smaller.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Allow selection of multiple directories:</b> Check to bypass the native directory selector
          and use QT's file dialog since the native directory selector usually doesn't allow you to select
          more than one directory. This applies for the 'Add folder' dialog, the file browser always
          allows multiple directory selection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Use advanced query syntax:</b> Check to enable
          <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/doc/Text_Search_Syntax" title="Text Search Syntax">advanced query syntax</a>
          parsing on your searches.
          This only applies for the search box at the top right of Picard, not the lookup buttons.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Show a quit confirmation dialog for unsaved changes:</b> Check to show a dialog when you try
          to quit Picard with unsaved files loaded. This may help prevent accidentally losing tag changes
          you've made, but not yet saved.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Begin browsing in the following directory:</b> By default, Picard remembers the last directory
          you loaded files from. If you check this box and provide a directory, Picard will start in
          the directory provided instead.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>User interface language:</b> By default, Picard will display in the language displayed by your
          operating system, however you can override this here if needed.
        </li>
