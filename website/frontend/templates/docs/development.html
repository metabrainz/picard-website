      <h1 id="dev_builds">Picard 2.0 Dev Builds</h1>
      <p>
      Picard 2.0 dev builds are now available via PyPi.
      To install the dev builds you need to have a Python 3.5 or greater.
      <br>
      You can get the latest version of Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow">here.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
      Once you have Python 3.5 or greater installed, proceed to your commandline and install Picard via the following command -
      <pre>pip3 install picard_dev</pre>

      If all went well, you should now have Picard 2.0 available to you as
      <pre>picard_dev</pre>
      on your commandline.

      Please note that Picard Dev version uses a different config file than your stable Picard installation. As such the settings and plugins will be on their default configuration.

      To use your stable config with the dev version, simple copy your "Picard.ini" file from you MusicBrainz user folder to "Picard Dev.ini" which can be found in the same folder.
