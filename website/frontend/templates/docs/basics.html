        You will need to <a href="/downloads/" title="MusicBrainz Picard">download MusicBrainz Picard</a> first.

      <h1 id="clustering">Clustering</h1>
      <span>
        <p>
          Start with opening individual music files or directories by dragging them into the left-hand pane. Picard
          will read the metadata from each of the files and unless they have been tagged before, the
          files will be deposited into the "Unmatched files" folder. Files that have been tagged before
          and contain MusicBrainz track identifiers will open up in the right-hand pane as a part of
          its release.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once Picard finishes processing the files, press the "Cluster" button. Picard will attempt to group the
          files into album clusters by examining the metadata and clustering files that appear to belong
          to the same album. Files that are not matched into album clusters will remain in the "Unmatched
          files" folder.
        </p>
      </span>

      <h1 id="lookup-query-mb">Lookup &amp; querying MusicBrainz</h1>
      <span>
        <h3 id="automatic-lookup">Automatic lookup</h3>
        <p>Select the cluster or file you want to lookup and use the "Lookup" button in the toolbar.</p>
        <p>Picard will query MusicBrainz with your existing metadata and attempt to find the best possible
          match.
        </p>

        <h3 id="scanning-fingerprinting-files">Scanning (fingerprinting) files</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of using release-oriented and metadata-dependent lookups, Picard can try and tag your files as
          single files (rather than a cluster) based on their
          <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/doc/Audio_Fingerprint" title="Audio Fingerprint">
          audio fingerprint</a>. If you select a set of files in the left-hand pane and click "Scan", Picard
          will find
          <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/doc/AcoustID" title="AcoustID">AcoustIDs</a> for your files
          and query MusicBrainz to find a track that matches them.
        </p>

        <h3 id="manual-lookup">Manual lookup</h3>
        <p>
          If you want granular control over how your files are being tagged, or the above methods provided inaccurate
          results (or no results), the alternative is to manually lookup and choose the correct release(s)
          for your files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Select the cluster or file you want to lookup and use one of the lower "Lookup" buttons in Picard. This
          opens the MusicBrainz website with a list of possible matches for your files along with details
          on what sets them apart, you can also disregard the lookup results and manually search for
          the appropriate album using the search box. Once you've found the correct album, click on the
          <img alt="mblookup-tagger.png" src="https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/-/images/3/39/mblookup-tagger.png" width="41"
          height="13" /> icon in the album title and Picard will load that album and its tracks into the right-hand
          pane for you to drag clusters/files onto.
        </p>
      </span>

      <h1 id="matching-files">Matching files &amp; saving</h1>
      <span>
        <p>
          The tracks in the right-hand pane will start out with a musical note icon, and as the tracks become associated
          with your files the icons will change to one of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a small rectangle ranging from red to green indicates the quality of the match, where red is
            a bad match and green is a good match</li>

          <li>a red error triangle means Picard encountered an error (e.g. permission error), click the file
            and read the status bar in the bottom of the Picard window to see the error</li>

          <li>a green check mark indicates the track is up to date and saved</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You can drag whole directories, multiple files or album clusters onto albums and Picard will attempt
          to match the dragged files to the album. Any track that doesn't match up well enough, will
          be added to an "Unmatched Files" sub-folder specific to that album. You can drag files out
          of this folder and into the right slots in the album to fix up the files that Picard couldn't
          get right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you've finished matching up your files to albums in the right-hand pane, right click the album and
          select the <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/doc/Release_Event" title="Release Event">release event</a> that
          corresponds to your specific release and then click the 'Save' button to save that track/album.
          Depending on your settings this may move the track to a new directory and/or rename the track
          according to its metadata. Take a look at the options dialog to fine tune your settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a file is in the right-hand pane the metadata that will be written by Picard can be viewed and edited
          if necessary. Left click the file and use the metadata comparison table at the bottom to view
          and, if necessary, edit the metadata. Remember to re-save the file(s) if you edit the metadata!
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you've saved an album and/or want to remove it from view, right click the album in the right-hand
          pane and click 'Remove'.

          Picard is very flexible and can be customized using
          <a href="/docs/scripting/" title="Picard Scripting">scripts</a>
          and <a href="/plugins/" title="Picard Plugins">plugins</a> to do things such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Rename and reorganise your collection using the
            <a href="/docs/scripting/#Functions" title="Picard Scripting">functions</a>
            provided in the scripting language
          </li>

          <li>
            Customize how Picard applies the MusicBrainz
            <a href="/docs/mappings/" title="Picard Tag Mapping">metadata</a> to your files
          </li>

          <li>Encapsulate scripting, download cover art, and add other functionality to Picard</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          A lot of Picard's power is in its extensive drag and drop features. Try some of these operations:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Drag a file from the file browser to an album track.</li>
          <li>Drag a file from the file browser to an album -- this attempts to match the file to the album
            automatically.</li>
          <li>Drag a directory from the file browser to an album -- this attempts to match all the files from
            the dir to the album.</li>
          <li>Drag an album cluster onto an album to match the cluster to the album.</li>
          <li>Drag one album onto another to match all the files from one to the other.</li>
          <li>Drag an album cluster into unmatched files to move the cluster back to unmatched.</li>
          <li>Drag unmatched files from an album onto another album or back to unmatched files.</li>
        </ul>
